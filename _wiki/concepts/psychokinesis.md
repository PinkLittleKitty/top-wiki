**Psychokinesis**, also referred to as **seizing**, is a supernatural ability in the Twenty One Pilots lore that allows users to possess or control other beings or vessels. It is most commonly associated with the Bishops and, later, Clancy.

## <span class="tape-accent-yellow">Description</span>

* **Origin:** Psychokinesis is believed to be practiced primarily by the Bishops in Dema.
* **Antlers of Ned:** Clancy gains access to psychokinesis through antlers harvested from the Neds, which enable neural expansion.
* **Vessels:** The process usually involves controlling the bodies of the Glorious Gone — citizens who have ended their lives through Vialism.

* **Bishop Control:** The Bishops use psychokinesis to possess corpses, vultures, and potentially living people.
* **Clancy’s Awakening:** After Keons’s death, Clancy uses psychokinesis to control Keons's corpse and start a fire in Dema (depicted in *“The Outside”* MV).
* **FPE Events:** During propaganda events like the Feature Performance Event, Bishops use psychokinesis to animate rotting corpses.
