**Smearing** is a mysterious phenomenon in the Twenty One Pilots lore associated with the influence or partial possession of a person by a Bishop through psychokinesis.

## <span class="tape-accent-yellow">Description</span>

* **Physical Markings:** Individuals who are smeared display dark stains or marks on their neck and hands.
* **Mental Disruption:** Smearing appears to affect memory and perception. Victims often experience events in a dissociative state.

* **Clancy:** Smeared by Nico near a river in Trench. He experiences the event out-of-body. (*Jumpsuit MV*)
> "He is suddenly approached by Nico, who ‘smears’ him. Clancy is inspired by the Banditos... to resist the smear and escapes its grasp."
