**Neon Gravestones** are the glowing headstones that form a necropolis outside the walls of Dema. They are physical and symbolic markers of those who have followed Vialism to its final end.

## <span class="tape-accent-yellow">Description</span>

* **Graveyard of the Glorious Gone:** These gravestones honor citizens who have taken their own lives under Dema’s ideology.
* **Weapon Material:** The stones can be dismantled and repurposed into weapons.
* **Location:** Encircle Dema in a glowing cemetery, representing both reverence and dread.

## <span class="tape-accent-red">Symbolism</span>

* **False Glorification:** Critique of the glamorization of self-destruction.
> "Neon gravestones try to call for my bones."
