Navigating the dense lore of Twenty One Pilots can be an adventure in itself! This guide provides a suggested order for experiencing the albums and canon music videos to follow the main narrative threads.

## <span class="tape-accent-yellow">Album Order</span>

The general progression of the story through albums is:

*   **Vessel:** (Thematic precursor, with some fans and Tyler himself suggesting its relevance. Its direct canonical ties are more subtle, e.g., "Migraine" referencing the "island of violence" - Voldsoy).
*   **Blurryface:** Details life in Dema and introduces the titular character/concept.
*   **Trench:** Focuses on escape from Dema, the Banditos, and the world of Trench.
*   **Scaled And Icy:** Explores Clancy's captivity and forced propaganda work for Dema.
*   **Clancy:** The culmination of Clancy's journey, rebellion, and confrontation with Dema.

## <span class="tape-accent-red">Music Video Order (Canon Storyline)</span>

These music videos directly contribute to the main narrative:

1.  **Heavydirtysoul**
2.  **Jumpsuit**
3.  **Nico and the Niners**
4.  **Levitate**
5.  **The Livestream Experience** (A canonical live event, not a traditional MV, but crucial for the *Scaled And Icy* era narrative)
6.  **Saturday**
7.  **The Outside**
8.  **Overcompensate**
9.  **Navigating**
10. **Paladin Strait**

*   **Supplementary Viewing:** The **"I Am Clancy"** video provides a helpful recap of the story leading up to the *Clancy* album.
