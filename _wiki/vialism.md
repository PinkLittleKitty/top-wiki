**Vialism** is the official belief system and doctrine enforced within the city of Dema in the *Trench* universe. It is upheld by the Nine Bishops and used to control the city's citizens both spiritually and psychologically.

* **Obedience to Bishops:** The Bishops use Vialism to legitimize their rule. It promotes blind loyalty and unquestioned obedience.
* **Repression of Emotion:** Emotional expression, creativity, and dissent are discouraged. This aligns with the themes of depression and emotional control in the album *Trench*.
* **Fear-Based Control:** Vialism uses fear and manipulation to prevent citizens from seeking escape or rebellion.
