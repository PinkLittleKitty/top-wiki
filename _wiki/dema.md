Dema is a city on the continent of Trench. It is surrounded by a large circular wall and has nine towers in the middle. It is also split into nine districts with each district being ruled by its own Bishop. The outside of the city is a necropolis, full of neon gravestones. The city is a very depressive place. The album ‘Blurryface’ details life in Dema. Citizens are not allowed to leave the city. Dema also has VIP Citizens who receive special treatment from the Bishops. It is sometimes referred to as the ‘Sacred Municipality of Dema’.
