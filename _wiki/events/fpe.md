The **Feature Performance Event (FPE)** is a staged propaganda broadcast organized by the Bishops in Dema, featuring Clancy as the main performer while under captivity.

## <span class="tape-accent-yellow">Description</span>

* **Hosted by the Bishops:** Two Bishops possess corpses of the Glorious Gone to serve as hosts.
* **Rotting Vessels:** The vessels visibly deteriorate throughout the event, demonstrating the decay masked by Dema’s control.
* **Location:** Aired via the in-universe show *Good Day Dema*.

## <span class="tape-accent-red">Purpose</span>

* **Propaganda:** Meant to showcase Dema’s dominance while turning Clancy into a figurehead.
* **Rebellion in Mind:** Despite his captivity, Clancy mentally escapes and daydreams of performing with the Torchbearer instead.
