**The Annual Assembly of the Glorified** is a significant, recurring event in Dema, where the city's VIP citizens gather. It serves as both a display of Dema's hierarchy and a critical juncture for key lore events.

## <span class="tape-accent-yellow">Description</span>

*   **Purpose:** An annual meeting for Dema's elite or "VIP Citizens," likely to reinforce Vialist ideology and the Bishops' control.
*   **Attendees:** Primarily the "Glorified" or VIPs of Dema.

## <span class="tape-accent-red">Notable Occurrences</span>

*   **Clancy's First Escape Attempt:** During one assembly, Clancy and other like-minded rebels attempted to escape Dema. Clancy was the only one to make it beyond the walls, though he did not meet the Banditos at that time.
*   **Submarine Event (*Saturday* MV):**
    *   One assembly was held on a submarine outside Dema. Clancy was forced to perform for the VIPs, guarded by individuals disguised as Bishops.
    *   This event became the setting for Keons' betrayal. Keons, using psychokinesis, possessed Trash the Dragon to destroy the submarine, freeing Clancy and the Torchbearer. This event is depicted in the *Saturday* music video.
