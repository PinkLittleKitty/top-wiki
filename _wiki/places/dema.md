![The city of Dema](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/60/5b/00605b50551ff175819019ed8c311d53.jpg)

**Dema** is a fictional, oppressive city at the bottom of the *Trench* world in the Twenty One Pilots universe. According to Tyler Joseph, *Trench* is “a world… made of trees and rocks and wild terrain,” with **Dema** located at its lowest point. The city is hidden behind towering walls and is ruled by nine tyrannical figures known as the **Bishops**. Within the lore, Dema is depicted as an isolated realm from which the protagonist (Clancy) feels trapped and longs to escape.

## <span class="tape-accent-yellow">Geography and Structure</span>

* **Location and environment:** Dema sits at the base of the *Trench* world – a dense, forested landscape – and is surrounded by the vast wilderness above. The city itself has an old, gothic feel (as seen in music videos), with graveyards and angular buildings, emphasizing its foreboding atmosphere.
* **Isolation by walls:** Dema is encircled by high, opaque **walls** that physically confine its inhabitants. This is explicitly referenced in the song *“Chlorine”*, where Tyler sings:
> “I plan my escape from walls they confined”
<p class="quote-attribution"> This symbolizes the prison-like barrier keeping Dema’s citizens locked inside. </p>
* **Control and separation:** The walls and the Bishops’ rule isolate Dema from the outside world. The protagonists rebel against this control – for example, *“Nico and the Niners”* proclaims:
> “Dema don’t control us”
<p class="quote-attribution"> This directly rejects the city’s grip. </p>

## <span class="tape-accent-red">The Nine Bishops</span>

* **Rulers of Dema:** Dema is governed by **nine Bishops**, who enforce the city’s harsh order and the faith of **Vialism** (the dominant ideology). Tyler Joseph confirmed that *“Nico is one of the nine bishops that govern the city of Dema.”* Each Bishop is a figure of authority who controls a sector of Dema, though only Nico (Nicholas Bourbaki) is explicitly named in canon.
* **Vialism:** The Bishops uphold a doctrine called *Vialism*. The reversed intro of *“Nico and the Niners”* includes the line *“we denounce Vialism”*, indicating that Vialism is the controlling faith or belief system in Dema that the characters ultimately reject. \[Read more about Vialism]\({{ '/wiki/vialism/' | relative\_url }})
* **Role and symbolism:** The Bishops serve as the antagonistic force in the lore, symbolizing the internal struggles (such as anxiety or self-doubt) that prevent the characters from escaping. *“When Bishops come together they will know that / Dema don’t control us”* emphasizes resistance to their rule.

## <span class="tape-accent-yellow">The Wall: Control and Isolation</span>

* **Physical barrier:** The **walls of Dema** are a constant motif representing entrapment. Lyrics like the following (in *“Chlorine”*) explicitly tie the walls to the protagonists’ desire to flee:
> “escape from walls they confined”
* **Enforcement of control:** Within the walls, the Bishops exercise complete control. The people are cut off from the outside world and kept in fear under Vialist rule. The chants *“Dema don’t control us”* in *“Nico and the Niners”* emphasize the characters’ fight against this control.
* **Resulting isolation:** The restrictive walls create a sense of hopelessness and claustrophobia. The concept of Dema in the lore mirrors how depression or oppressive forces can isolate a person from the world, stifling creativity and individuality.

## <span class="tape-accent-yellow">Psychological and Thematic Symbolism</span>

* **Mental struggles:** Dema symbolizes the darker parts of the mind – such as **depression, anxiety, and insecurity**. Tyler Joseph has said that many of the band’s songs deal with anxiety and self-doubt, and that *Trench* represents the feeling of needing to escape those emotions.
* **Need to escape:** The overarching theme (“need to escape”) highlights a transitional life phase. The Trench narrative focuses on breaking free (leaving Dema) as a metaphor for personal growth and recovery. Lyrics like:
> “escape from walls they confined”
<p class="quote-attribution">
literally express the desire to break out of confining mindsets. [See also: Clancy]({{ '/wiki/characters/clancy/' | relative_url }})</p>
* **Control and creativity:** The rigid structure of Dema/Vialism suggests suppression of individuality and creativity. The protagonist’s journey (and the Banditos’ rebellion) represents reclaiming one’s voice. For example, *“Chlorine”* mixes imagery of poison and chemical processes, hinting at using creativity (the “chemical” beat) to cope and transform struggles.
* **Color symbolism:** Dema is dominated by dark reds (Bishops) and browns, reflecting danger and oppression. In contrast, yellow (Banditos, sun imagery) symbolizes hope. Though colors are a visual detail, they reinforce the thematic divide between confinement (red, Dema) and freedom (yellow, light/east).

## <span class="tape-accent-red">Symbolic Leadership: Nico and Blurryface</span>

* **Nico’s identity:** The character **Nico** (featured in *“Morph”* and *“Nico and the Niners”*) is confirmed to be one of Dema’s Bishops. In interviews, Tyler Joseph revealed that Nico’s full name is *Nicholas Bourbaki*, which he calls “Blurryface’s real name.”
> “Blurryface’s real name.”
* **Connection to *Blurryface*:** Blurryface was the personification of Tyler’s insecurities on the previous album. By naming the Bishop Nico as Nicholas Bourbaki (Blurryface’s true identity), the band made Blurryface essentially one of Dema’s rulers. This continuity implies that the struggle in *Trench/Dema* is a direct continuation of the battle against the insecurities from *Blurryface*. [Learn more: Blurryface]({{ '/wiki/blurryface/' | relative_url }})
* **Symbolic role:** Nico (as Blurryface) embodies the deceptive influence the Bishops have over Dema’s citizens. The song title *“Nico and the Niners”* itself suggests Nico and his group of nine (bishops). By decoding Nico’s name, the lore reveals that escaping Dema also means overcoming the Blurryface-era demons.
