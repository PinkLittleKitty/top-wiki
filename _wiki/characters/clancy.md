![Clancy](https://i.redd.it/x80hsjq93jkc1.png)

**Clancy** is the central character and narrator in the *Trench* era of the Twenty One Pilots lore. He serves as the listener’s window into the city of Dema and the struggle against its oppressive regime.

## <span class="tape-accent-yellow">Background</span>

* **Origin:** Clancy is a citizen of Dema who grows increasingly disillusioned with its doctrine and rule.
* **Journals:** His writings appear on the now-archived website (dmaorg.info), chronicling his observations and attempts to escape. The posts are cryptic, poetic, and emotionally raw.
> "They are asleep. It's time to wake up."
