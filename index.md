You've breached the walls of Dema and stepped into the vast, echoing expanse of Trench. This archive is your guide through the shadows, a collection of fragmented truths, whispered theories, and defiant anthems.

Clancy's letters, the Bishops' decrees, the Banditos' codes â€“ it's all here.
Explore the [lore wiki]({{ '/wiki/' | relative_url }}) or dive into the [song lyrics]({{ '/lyrics/' | relative_url }}).

The truth is a weapon. Arm yourself.

**East is Up.**
