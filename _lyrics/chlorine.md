Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical

Sippin' on straight chlorine

Lovin' what I'm tastin'
Venom on my tongue, dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations
Help my body run

I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical

Sippin' on straight chlorine

Fall out of formation
I plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation
Grows while I decay

I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

Hide you in my coat pocket
Where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible
You wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead
My body lives on lead
The last two lines may read
Incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I'm at it again, cyanidin trend
I'm a chemical chemical
I'm a chemical chemical
I'm a chemical chemical

I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
(Beat is a chemical)
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
(Moment is medical)

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical

I'm so sorry, I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A new democracy
I'm not trying to be loud
But I've been running from the crowd
Is it propaganda? Maybe
I can't be sure, 100%

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
(Sippin' on straight chlorine)
Let the vibe slide over me
(Sippin' on straight chlorine)
Beat is a chemical
(Sippin' on straight chlorine)
Let the vibe slide over me
(Sippin' on straight chlorine)
